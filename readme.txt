As someone who has worked on frontend development projects/jobs for years in javascript and typescript, I did not need a lot of resources to complete this assignment. However, I did use generative AI to help me understand how to properly implement the vega lite. I used it in the format of teaching me the proper schema, and giving me a sample setup for the system, which I then implemented. Beyond that, I used js/ts library pages such as MDN Web Docs (such as https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString) to look up more specific functions.
